# OpenSaysPi

The goal of the project was to demonstrate a successful door-lock system with QR code based authentication. The QR code unlock leverages the greater processing power of the Raspberry Pi for decoding and low-level kernel modules for quick response from servos and status LEDs. The project resulted in a complete, compact, and enclosed system that could easily be switched from independent operation on battery for several hours or direct power via a USB power supply. All components of the system are designed to be as low power as possible while maintaining the core functionality.
